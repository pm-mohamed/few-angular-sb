<br></br>

## 1-Typography

> Update `text.stories.mdx` with the various font variations from the design.

> First you need to define styling rules inside `src/lib/styles/utils/_fonts.scss`, then Update `text.stories.mdx` with the correct values and at last update the enum inside `src/lib/components/pm-text/pm-text.component.ts` with the new values.

> Any font of size 19px can be added as copy-l, 16px as copy-m, 14px as copy s and 12px as copy-xs.

> Any font of size 19px can be added as copy-l folowed by medium/regular/bold/light e.g: copy-l-medium/copy-l-regular

> Any color variation can be added as primary/secondary e.g: copy-l-regular-primary/copy-l-regular-secondary

> Each font size variation (copy-l/copy-m/copy-s)should have separate canvas and title that contain all other variations as stories (medium/regular/primary/secondary)


## 2-Colors

> Use [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/db995a-654236-d6d4a0-da7635-e24e1b) to generate new color variations.

> Update the new color values inside `src/lib/styles/utils/_colors.scss`, make sure to define it in both light and dark theme.

> You can name the colors variation secondary, it must be sorted according to contrast in which 100 take the darkest variation and the largest number as the lightest color.

> Update `color.stories.mdx` with the newly generated colors.

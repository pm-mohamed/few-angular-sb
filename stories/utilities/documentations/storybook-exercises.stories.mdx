## 1-Typography

> Keywords: Storybook - SCSS

- Update `text.stories.mdx` with the various font variations from the design.

- First you need to define styling rules inside `src/lib/styles/utils/_fonts.scss`, then Update `text.stories.mdx` with the correct values and at last update the enum inside `src/lib/components/pm-text/pm-text.component.ts` with the new values.

- Any font of size 19px can be added as copy-l, 16px as copy-m, 14px as copy s and 12px as copy-xs.

- Any font of size 19px can be added as copy-l folowed by medium/regular/bold/light e.g: copy-l-medium/copy-l-regular

- Any color variation can be added as primary/secondary e.g: copy-l-regular-primary/copy-l-regular-secondary

- Each font size variation (copy-l/copy-m/copy-s)should have separate canvas and title that contain all other variations as stories (medium/regular/primary/secondary)

- Add Primary button with sort icon variation to `stories/components/button/primary.stories.mdx` in a separate canvas and title. Everything is defined you just need to pass it the correct props.

- Create new file `secondary.stories.mdx` and define secondary button variation just like the primary button, you just need to create the mdx file, pass it the correct props and style it inside `pm-button.component.scss` (the type and the html is already added).

- Use BEM and custom properties for styling.
